 <p>Titanic is an unforgettable love story set against the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. The film follows Jack and Rose, two people from very different worlds, who find love aboard the doomed ship. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver emotional performances that make you feel every moment of their connection. The visuals were groundbreaking for its time, and the music, especially “My Heart Will Go On,” still gives chills. Though a bit long, it remains one of the most emotional and visually stunning films ever made.</p>
